• Convert the about page to use a template as well, using a template called about.html.
• Within the new about.html template, add a picture stored within your project’s
static files.
• On the about page, include a line that says, This tutorial has been put together
by <your-name>.
• In your Django project directory, create a new directory called media, download a
picture of a cat and save it to the media directory as cat.jpg.
• In your about page, add in the <img> tag to display the picture of the cat, to ensure
that your media is being served correctly. Keep the static image of Rango in your
index page so that your app has working examples of both static and media files.
